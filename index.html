                <p >Allow me to introduce myself - I'm Casey, an Australian with a passion for travel and photography. I've had the pleasure
                of calling cities like Hong Kong and London home, but currently reside in the bustling metropolis of New York City. In
                addition to my love for exploring new places and capturing moments through my lens, I'm also a naturally curious and
                driven individual who is committed to staying fit and healthy.
                <br>
                Professionally, I have worked in financial risk management for over a decade, with a special focus on credit risk
                exposure calculations. My expertise in this area has helped me deliver results for a diverse range of clients, and I
                take pride in helping businesses manage risk effectively.
                <br>
                When I'm not working, you'll often find me training for triathlons or exploring the city on foot. I'm a dedicated runner
                and am excited to be completing the NYC marathon for the second time later this year.
                <br>
                In addition to my work and athletic pursuits, I'm also interested in coding and have recently started taking a course to
                improve my skills. I've always enjoyed tinkering with code, and I believe that formal training will help me advance my
                career in the future.
                <br>
                On this page, you'll find a portfolio of my work, which showcases my professional experience and personal interests. I'm
                excited to share my journey with you and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals along the way.</p>
